# Phylogenetics

Phylogenetics is the study of the relatedness of genes and species. The first branched phylogenetic tree was created by Darwin as a rough sketch in a notebook in 1837 which has become known as the "I think" sketch.

Beside this he scribbled:

>Case must be that one generation should have as many living as now.
>To do this & to have many species in same genus (as is) requires extinction.
>Thus between A and B immense gap of relation.
>C and B the finest gradation, B and D rather greater distinction.
>Thus genera would be formed. â€” bearing relation to ancient types with several extinct forms.

This was the first articulation of the idea of `descent with modification` which underpins our understanding of evolution by natural selection to this day. What the figure and the caption illustrate is the idea that all species alive today share common ancestors and that over the immense time since the divergence of all extant species, an incalculable number of other species which *fill the gaps* between modern species have gone extinct. This process of extinction of less well suited organisms and the survival of more well suited ones is the engine that drives the evolutionary process. This was a revolutionary insight by Darwin is made even more remarkable by the fact that he had no idea about genetics or the process by which novel character emergence could come to pass.
